tote context snapshot — 2026-02-22

## Current state

Version: 0.5.0 (unreleased, all commits on main)
Last tag: v0.3.0 (at WO-4 commit)
All v0.3 and v1.0 roadmap items complete except owner workload inheritance and notifications.

## Completed work orders

WO-1:  Pod restart after salvage (fast recovery)
WO-2:  Demote debug logging to V(1)
WO-3:  Max image size guard (--max-image-size, default 2 GiB)
WO-4:  README update for v0.2 architecture
WO-5:  Backup registry push (--backup-registry, go-containerregistry)
WO-6:  Grafana dashboard (charts/tote/dashboards/tote.json + ConfigMap)
WO-7:  CI optimization (4 parallel jobs, .golangci-full.yml for CI)
WO-8:  mTLS for gRPC (internal/tlsutil, --tls-cert/key/ca, Helm tls.enabled)
WO-9:  Leader election (controller-runtime LeaderElection)
WO-10: SalvageRecord CRD (api/v1alpha1, replaces pod annotations)
WO-11: CreateContainerError detection (corrupt image cleanup via RemoveImage RPC)

## Architecture (13 internal packages + CRD)

version, config, detector, resolver, inventory, events, metrics,
controller, agent, session, transfer, registry, tlsutil
api/v1alpha1 (SalvageRecord CRD)

## Key decisions

- containerd v2 client API (github.com/containerd/containerd/v2/client)
- events.EventRecorder (not deprecated record.EventRecorder)
- mgr.GetEventRecorder("tote") (not GetEventRecorderFor)
- ExportFunc type avoids circular import between registry and agent
- Fixed ServerName "tote" for mTLS (avoids IP SANs per pod)
- golangci-lint v2 config format; local binary is v1 (CI uses v2)
- Pre-commit hook blocks Co-Authored-By lines
- SalvageRecord replaces pod annotations for idempotency + history
- controller-gen v0.20.1 for CRD generation

## Open issues

- Local golangci-lint is v1, config is v2 format. make lint fails locally.
  CI works fine. Could install v2 locally or keep as-is.
- v0.3.0 tag was premature (only covered WO-1-4). No v0.4.0 or v0.5.0 tags yet.
